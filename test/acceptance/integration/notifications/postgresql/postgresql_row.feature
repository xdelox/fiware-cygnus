Feature: Store in postgresql new notifications per row from context broker
  As a cygnus user
  I want to be able to store in postgresql new notifications per row from context broker

  @happy_path
  Scenario Outline: stored new notifications in postgresql from context broker with or without metadata
    Given copy properties.json file from "epg_properties.json" to test "postgresql-sink" and sudo local "false"
    And configuration of cygnus instances with different ports "true", agents files quantity "1", id "test" and in "row" mode
    And copy flume-env.sh, grouping rules file from "grouping_rules.conf", log4j.properties, krb5.conf and restart cygnus service. This execution is only once "true"
    And verify if cygnus is installed correctly
    And verify if postgresql is installed correctly
